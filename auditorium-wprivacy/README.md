### Auditorium but with added privacy ###
This is exactly the same as [Gottem's auditorium module](https://gitgud.malvager.net/Wazakindjes/unrealircd_mods/src/master/man/auditorium.md) (so for documentation and usage, you should check his repo =]), except for this one, if a user does not have an `+q/a/o` channel mode, they will only see messages from people who DO have `+q/a/o` and when the first word of that sentence starts with their nick.

Caters for general tabwhoring, so if you were to send a channel message to `Lamer123`, it would accept `Lamer123:` and `Lamer123,` in addition to just `Lamer123`.
