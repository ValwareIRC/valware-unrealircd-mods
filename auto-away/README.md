##Warning: don't use unless you want your network to look like a deserted wasteland and away messages everywhere -.-

This module lets you automate marking your users as `AWAY` based on their idle time.

Defaults to 2 hours of inactivity with the reason "Idle".

Example config:

`auto-away { time 2h; reason "Idle"; }`


`Valware is marked away: [Auto-Away] Idle`
