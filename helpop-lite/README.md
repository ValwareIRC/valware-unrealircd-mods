## [DEPRECATED]
### This module has been moved to `helpop`. This is because the non-lite version contained a `report` command, which has now been covered by another module, and if you would like to continue using `/report`, I recommend Gottem's module found below.

- [Gottem's REPORT module MD](https://gitgud.malvager.net/Wazakindjes/unrealircd_mods/src/master/man/report.md)

"Lite" version of my helpop module.


provides:

- Usermode 'h' (HelpOp)
- Channelmode 'g' (HelpOp-only chan)
- Special whois (swhois) line saying the user "is available for help"
- Command /HELPOPS (same syntax as GLOBOPS and LOCOPS, and sends to all with usermode 'h')
