This is a port of the Elmer module, and instead forces the user to appear to be mistyping from being drunk.

```
/DRUNK [-list|-help|<nick>]
/SOBER <nick>
```
 Examples:

List users who are Drunk (Oper):

`/DRUNK -list`

View this output:

`/DRUNK -help`

Add a user whose nick is Lamer32 as Drunk:

`/DRUNK Lamer32`

Remove a user whose nick is Lamer32 as Drunk:

`/SOBER Lamer32`


`[18:35:39] <@Valware> why let your users talk normally when you can make them talk like they're drunk instead`
