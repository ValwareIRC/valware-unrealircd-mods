## Valware's UnrealIRCd Modules ##

Welcome to my module repository.

All of my up-to-date/useful modules are actively contributed to [`unrealircd/unrealircd-contrib`](https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd-contrib), and so you can download them as usual using `./unrealircd module install third/modulename` without having to worry about including this repo in the `modules.sources.list`.

Any modules you see here that are not listed are because they are useless, like `ayyy.c` which is just a fancy quit message really, and `cap-external-reg` which is not compatible with anything (yet) and so is not expected to actually work on your server without making something to work with it.

The only reasons the modules exist here is so that you have somewhere to make a Pull Request or Issue, should you notice any bugs or problems.

If you are trying to use a module from here that already exists in the official third-party module repository, it's important to note that when you go to install it, UnrealIRCd will automatically upgrade it to the version that exists in the official repository. So you should not use modules from this repository.

## Problems and Errors ##
If you notice any errors, or if something is not working as it should, or even if you believe a port of any of my modules is missing something it had in a previous rendition, please do not hesitate to submit a bug report, either [open an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/ValwareIRC/valware-unrealircd-mods/issues/new?assignees=ValwareIRC&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=My+shiny+new+bug+report) or [submit a bug report on my website.](https://valware.uk/bugreport/) Either way, it is appreciated!

## Got a request for a new module? ##

That's great!

If you've got a request for a private module and do not want the module publicly listed I charge a fee.

If your request is for a module you want to exist for everyone, I will decide if I agree that it is useful, and if so I will make it for free.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk! I'd love to hear your ideas.

You can make a request by [creating an Issue in this repository.](https://github.com/ValwareIRC/valware-unrealircd-mods/issues/new?assignees=ValwareIRC&labels=enhancement&template=module-request.md&title=My+shiny+new+module+request).

Alternatively you can [head over to my website](https://valware.uk/forums/forum/unrealircd-modules/) to make the request.

## Something missing in an existing module? ##

Oh no! I'm sorry that it isn't working correctly, but thank you for coming to let me know!

You can let me know what's missing by [creating an Issue here](https://github.com/ValwareIRC/valware-unrealircd-mods/issues/new?assignees=ValwareIRC&labels=enhancement&template=feature_update.md&title=My+shiny+new+feature+request), or you can [tell me on my website!](https://valware.uk/forums/forum/unrealircd-modules/)
