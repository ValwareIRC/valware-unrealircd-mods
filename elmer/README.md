Force a user to speak like Elmer;

My port of AngryWolf's module for Unreal3.2 of the same name

replaces 'r' and 'l' with 'w' on a victims output:

Syntax: /ELMER Valware
Syntax: /DELMER Valware

`<Valware> I'm hunting rabbits, be very very quiet.`

  ->
  
`<Valware> I'm hunting wabbits, be vewy vewy quiet.`
  
  
(The user will not see that they are talking like Elmer)


Requires oper

Cannot be set on other opers
